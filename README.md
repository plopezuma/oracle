Oracle DBA scripts

This repository is a compilation of scripts from multiple sources. Some of them have been either created or modified by myself but I do not claim ownership of any of the original scripts.
The scripts have been adapted to fit my personal needs, and I hope whoever gets a copy can use them and take advantage of them as well as I have. 
For questions, comments, please write to plopezuma@gmail.com

Thank you
